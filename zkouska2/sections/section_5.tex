I will use the per partes becuase 
I don't see how the sub-method will 
help me here.

\begin{center}
    \textit{Per partes method}
    $$ \int uv' = uv - \int vu' $$
\end{center}

The \textit{per partes} method is derived 
from the product rule in derivation. 

\begin{align*}
    (uv)' &= u'v + uv' \\
\end{align*}
